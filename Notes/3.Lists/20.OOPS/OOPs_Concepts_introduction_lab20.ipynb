For example - you have a class animal, and all animals speak. But they speak differently. Here, the \"speak\" behavior is polymorphic in a sense and depends on the animal. So, the abstract \"animal\" concept does not actually \"speak\", but specific animals (like dogs and cats) have a concrete implementation of the action \"speak\".\n"

    "    In this question, The probelm we need to solve the queries of Bittu. The problem is Bittu is very creative child which\n",

    "        1. What is the time in only minutes.\n",
    "        2. What is the time in only seconds.\n",
    "        3. If two time is enter the what is the total of them.\n",
    "    So Your task is to create a class which solve the all queries of Bittu.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.\n",
    "    1. Make a method addTime which should take two time object and add them. \n",

    "            (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)\n",
    "    2. Make a method displayTime which should print the time.\n",
    "    3. Make a method DisplayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time. \n",
    "        E.g.- \n",
    "            (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.\n",
    "    4. Make a method DisplaySecond which should display the total second in the Time.\n",
    "        E.g.-\n",
    "            (1 hr 2 min) should display 3720 seconds.\n",
