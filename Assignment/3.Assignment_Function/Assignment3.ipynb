    "# Introduction\n",
    "    For this assignment, read the scenario below and then respond to the problem statement described.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scenario\n",
    "    The 'Man of the Match' award of a 50-over cricket match is decided by computing points earned by players. The points \n",
    "    are calculated on the basis of the following rules:\n",
    "    # Batting\n",
    "            • 1 point for 2 runs scored\n",
    "            • Additional 5 points for half century\n",
    "            • Additional 10 points for century\n",
    "            • 2 points for strike rate (runs/balls faced) of 80-100\n",
    "            • Additional 4 points for strike rate>100\n",
    "            • 1 point for hitting a boundary (four) and 2 points for over boundary (six)\n",
    "    #  Bowling\n",
    "            • 10 points for each wicket\n",
    "            • Additional 5 points for three wickets per innings\n",
    "            • Additional 10 points for 5 wickets or more in innings\n",
    "            • 4 points for economy rate (runs given per over) between 3.5 and 4.5\n",
    "            • 7 points for economy rate between 2 and 3.5\n",
    "            • 10 points for economy rate less than 2\n",
    "    # Fielding\n",
    "            • 10 points each for catch/stumping/run out\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The performance of each player is stored in a dictionary object. Displayed below is data for 5 players.\n",
    "    p1={'name':'Virat Kohli', 'role':'bat', 'runs':112, '4':10, '6':0, 'balls':119, 'field':0}\n",
    "    p2={'name':'du Plessis', 'role':'bat', 'runs':120, '4':11, '6':2, 'balls':112, 'field':0}\n",
    "    p3={'name':'Bhuvneshwar Kumar', 'role':'bowl', 'wkts':1, 'overs':10, 'runs':71, 'field':1}\n",
    "    p4={'name':'Yuzvendra Chahal', 'role':'bowl', 'wkts':2, 'overs':10, 'runs':45, 'field':0}\n",
    "    p5={'name':'Kuldeep Yadav', 'role':'bowl', 'wkts':3, 'overs':10, 'runs':34, 'field':0}\n",
    "#     You Can add more players\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "    Assuming that these are the top 5 performers, write a Python program to decide the player\n",
    "    with the highest points. Develop separate functions to compute batting and bowling points\n",
    "    and save them in a module. These functions should be imported into the main code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assignment Submission\n",
    "    Your submission should have fully functional code with:\n",
    "    1. One module containing the required functions.\n",
    "    2. One script file with the main code which computes the top player amongst the 5 given players.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When your script is run, it should generate a result which might look like this:\n",
    "        {'name': 'Virat Kohli', 'batscore': 73}\n",
    "        {'name': 'du Plessis', 'batscore': 84}\n",
    "        {'name': 'Bhuvneshwar Kumar', 'bowlscore': 20}\n",
    "        {'name': 'Yuzvendra Chahal', 'bowlscore': 30}\n",
    "        {'name': 'Kuldeep Yadav', 'bowlscore': 45}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hint:\n",
    "    The calculation of points will require conditional logic to be applied. Since this is to be\n",
    "    performed for 5 players, there’s looping involved. Defining and calling functions from a\n",
    "    module is also required.\n",
    "    You can approach this assignment in the following sequence:\n",
    "    1. First, create the required variables.\n",
    "    2. Next, convert the rules into expressions and conditions. For example, points = runs/2\n",
    "    or if runs >50, points = points+2 and so on.\n",
    "    3. Next, define each of the two functions for batting or fielding and bowling.\n",
    "    4. Finally write your program using the conditions and the functions.\n",
    "    Learning outcomes being evaluated\n",
    "    • Use conditional logic in Python programs\n",
    "    • Write programs using conditionals, loops, iterators and generators, functions and\n",
    "    modules and packages."
